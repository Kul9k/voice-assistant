# voice-assistant
A small voice assistant built on artificial intelligence, specifically DeepSeek 3.1. The project is small; it was created by a Russian schoolchild, and the text was taken from Google Translate. Incidentally, at the time of writing this, I'm 14 years old, and the version is 1.2.0. The text in the code (print("text")) was generated by AI for aesthetic purposes.
The dependencies are quite problematic. It's better to use Python 3.11.9, which is the best version at the moment. 12.30.2025
